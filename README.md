# <b><u>Low-light Image Enhancement using an Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network</u></b>

We present our solution to the low-light image enhancement problem which is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that is trained in an unsupervised setting. Due to the absence of paired training data, we rely on a series of self-regularization techniques to guide the training process. As a result of training the model in an unsupervised setting, our solution is applicable to images from a broad domain and achieves superior results. We present a handful of representative examples below for your perusal.
