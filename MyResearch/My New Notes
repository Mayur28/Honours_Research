I'm trying without handling the image path! Looks like this will need special attention when saving the images( This will come much later)
SPICE EVERYTHING UP, TOO SIMILIAR!!!
Blend it with Mask Shadow GAN
 Find other papers as well
 Do with my own understanding!!!
This is just temporary, be ruthless thereafter

 Check the story about the transformation needed for preprocessing ( If RGB-> BGR is really necessary)
 I AM working directly in BGR, only when saving for display images, save the image in RGB
 
 Check if the config thing in EGAN is really necessary or not.
 
 # There is a lot of varitation that can come out of the VGG functions
 Really make this my own! Experiment and only if really broken, revert to their altered form
